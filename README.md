# UHH_UB_AgeAwareHRI
Collaboration between UHH and UB for age aware HRI.

### Installation
*setup.bash* installs the necessary python packages in a virtual environment *~/.arvenv*.

The Git Repository is treated as a catkin workspace. 

*setup.bash* also handles the installation of ROS requirements.

Requires **Python >= 3.8**.

1) Make shell file executable with
    ```bash
   chmod +x setup.bash
    ```
3) Then execute with
    ```bash
   ./setup.bash
    ```
5) Then initialize pycram with
    ```bash
   ./setup_pycram.bash
    ```
6) If the pycram branch was updated pull all changes using
   ```bash
   ./update_pycram.bash
    ```

During installation console will ask for sudo password.


### Start-up
1) Open a terminal and start ROS with ```roscore```.
2) Open another terminal and activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source ~/.arvenv/bin/activate
   ```
3) Navigate to UHH_UB_AgeAwareHRI Git repository and source the catkin workspace:
   ```bash
    source ./devel/setup.bash
   ```
4) Start these in separate terminals. 
   Start the speech and age recognition:
    ```bash
   rosrun speech_processing speech_processing_client.py
   ```
   Start the dialogue manager:
    ```bash
   rosrun speech_processing dialogue_system_node.py
   ```
   Start the speech synthesis:
    ```bash
   rosrun speech_processing speech_synthesis.py
   ```
 
5) To start the pycram, first make sure you initialized pycram as outlined in 3) of the installation. Open another terminal and source the workspace:
   ```bash
   source ./devel/setup.bash
   ```
   and the environment:
   ```bash
   source ~/.arvenv_pycram/bin/activate
   ```
   Start the pycram demo using (Note: this will launch rviz with an appropriate config, and the demo will start as soon as everything has loaded):
   ```bash
   ./run_robot_demo.sh 
   ```
   If you need to modify or update the pycram files in some way, you may consider first deleting the files generated by ```./setup_pycram.bash``` using the following command from workspace:
   ```bash
   ./clean_pycram.sh 
   ```
   
### Instructions to interrupting the PR2's actions per hand
Open up a new terminal in your workspace, and source the workspace using ```./setup.bash```
The Interrupt Client can be tested injecting the following rostopic pub command at various points in the demo, whenever the robot prints "I am now interruptable for 5 seconds":
   ```bash
   rostopic pub /robot_minor_interruption speech_processing/message_to_robot "command: ''
   age: 0
   confidence: 0.0
   add_object:
   - {type: 'cereal', color: 'red', name: '', location: '', size: ''}
   del_object:
   - {type: 'milk', color: 'blue', name: '', location: '', size: ''}" 
   ``` 
   
If you want to switch from cereal back to the milk, after interrupting once use:
   ```bash
   rostopic pub /robot_minor_interruption speech_processing/message_to_robot "command: ''
   age: 0
   confidence: 0.0
   add_object:
   - {type: 'milk', color: 'blue', name: '', location: '', size: ''}
   del_object:
   - {type: 'cereal', color: 'red', name: '', location: '', size: ''}"
   ```
